# ☕ Coffee Sales Analysis — Power BI Dashboard

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes coffee sales data to uncover sales trends, product performance, revenue contribution.  
The analysis was performed using SQL for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Power BI for interactive visualization and business insights.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end analytics workflow — from raw data exploration to insight-driven dashboard design.

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains transactional coffee sales data with the following key fields:
- `date` – Order date
- `coffee_name` – Type of coffee sold
- `cash_type` – Payment method (Cash / Card)
- `money` – Order value

##  SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
SQL was used to answer core business questions before building the dashboard.

### Key EDA topics:
- Highest sales days per month
- Coffee-wise order count and revenue
- Revenue contribution & Pareto (80/20) analysis
- Payment type behavior
- Average order value and revenue volatility
- Month-over-Month (MoM) growth analysis

## Power BI Dashboard Overview

The interactive dashboard is divided into three main pages, each answering a specific business question.

### 1. Executive Overview
**Purpose:** High-level performance snapshot

**Key insights:**
- Total Orders
- Total Revenue
- Average Order Value
- Month-ON-Month growth
- Best-performing coffee by revenue and orders

### 2. Product & Revenue Analysis
**Purpose:** Understand which products drive business value

**Key insights:**
- Revenue vs order volume by coffee type
- Coffee-wise revenue contribution
- Best selling coffee

### 3. Time Intelligence Analysis
**Purpose:** Identify sales patterns over time

**Key insights:**
